# A better ISA scheduler:

### Tested on:
* Chrome 63

### Reported not working on:
* Safari 11
* Firefox Quantum

This project is aimed at EPFL masters students, more specifically in Computer Science, to offer them a better visualisation of their course schedule than what offer the default tool IS Academia. It offers much improved interactivity and fluidity, without requiring reloading of the page to change the schedule.

### Usage
To use it, simply open the website at https://miomjon.github.io/DataViz2017/ 
Then, courses can be added to the schedule by clicking on them on the list. From there, most elements on the screen can be interacted with to highlight certain informations. Here are some examples:

1. Clicking on a day on the top row will highlight all courses that are scheduled during the given day
2. Clicking on the specilization bars on the bottom will highlight courses that are part of the specialization
3. Clicking on the credits count will highlight how many credits each course is worth
